![Leg space](/uploads/25d537fd-96ea-4963-8700-ff384398c1b6.jpeg "Leg space")

Some of the features that stand out for us are the ample leg room, the quality of the materials used on this kayak and in particular the durability of the materials used.  When it comes to repairs of the [**Intex Challenge Kayak**](#), they are also fast and straight forward to do.

## Fits in a Bag

The fact that this kayak fits in a bag and doesn’t weigh as much as other kayaks (25lbs for the K1 version and 35lbs for the K2 version) means it is also highly transportable, which makes it perfect for weekend trips where you can just put it in the back of the car and have an adventure weekend.

## Lightweight - When compared to other kayaks

Some female customers who have bought this kayak have commented that it is great because it is a lot lighter than a traditional kayak and makes it easier for them to transport.  We think the lightweight nature of this kayak is perfect for those who want to be out and about and don’t want the hassle of transporting a more traditional ridged kayak.

## Easy to assemble

This is actually one of the easiest kayaks that we have reviewed to assemble, thanks to the Boston valves that enable you to deflate and inflate the craft extremely quickly.

## Rugged Materials

We have touched on this earlier but the kayak is made of rugged materials and a lot of customers have actually reported that they have taken their dog with them in the kayak and have not any issues from nail punctures.  (We don’t advise you do do this obviously, but it does show the fact that some customers are willing to trust this kayak enough to take their pets with them!

## How does the Intex Challenger Kayak Compare to Other Kayaks on the Market?

This is certainly one of the most popular kayaks that we have ever reviewed, so in terms of overall popularity of the [**Intex Challenge Kayak**](#) it is currently unbeatable at its current price point.  However this is not to say that it is the most high performance Kayak out there.  What the Intex does really well though is it makes Kayaking fun for people who may not normally Kayak and also packs it in to an affordable package that doesn’t break the bank.  The fact that it can be inflated and deflated relatively easily and is lightweight when compared to a traditional kayak, also scores a lot of points with more casual kayakers who are maybe looking for an occasional fun weekend away on the coast and again are not looking for a performance Kayak that will get them to the highest speeds.

## Our Final Verdict

**5/5**

This is a tried and tested product by over 20,000 customers and although the [**Intex Challenger Kayak **](#)isn’t the most high performance Kayak out there, it is certainly a fun experience to use and this is why we have given it such a high rating.  Even if you are a high performance Kayaker you may find the Intex fun to use on your down time if you need something that is more easily transportable.

**We hope you found this review of the** [**Intex Challenge Kayak**](#) **useful.  If you have any thoughts on this particular Kayak please let us know.**
