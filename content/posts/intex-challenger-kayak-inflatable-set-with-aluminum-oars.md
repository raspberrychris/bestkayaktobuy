## Fits in a Bag

The fact that this kayak fits in a bag and doesn’t weigh as much as other kayaks (25lbs for the K1 version and 35lbs for the K2 version) means it is also highly transportable, which makes it perfect for weekend trips where you can just put it in the back of the car and have an adventure weekend.

Some female customers who have bought this kayak have commented that it is great because it is a lot lighter than a traditional kayak and makes it easier for them to transport.  We think the lightweight nature of this kayak is perfect for those who want to be out and about and don’t want the hassle of transporting a more traditional ridged kayak.

## Easy to assemble

This is actually one of the easiest kayaks that we have reviewed to assemble, thanks to the Boston valves that enable you to deflate and inflate the craft extremely quickly.
